SOC113 – Suspicious hh.exe Usage

Platform: LetsDefend
Severity: Low
Verdict: False Positive

The alert was triggered because the user manually executed hh.exe to open a .chm (Compiled HTML Help) file.

During the investigation, it was confirmed that hh.exe was launched directly by the user. The file involved was verified to be a legitimate .chm help file. No suspicious child processes were observed, and there were no signs of persistence or any malicious activity on the system.

The root cause of the alert was normal usage of hh.exe to open a valid .chm file, which is expected behavior for Windows HTML Help.

This activity was determined to be normal user behavior. No indicators of compromise were identified, and the alert was closed as a false positive.
