## Alerts – LetsDefend

This folder contains SOC alert analysis labs completed on the LetsDefend platform.

Each file represents a single alert (named using the rule ID and rule name), along with my investigation notes, conclusion, and a screenshot as proof of hands-on work.

All alerts are analyzed in a controlled lab environment and documented for learning and practice purposes.
